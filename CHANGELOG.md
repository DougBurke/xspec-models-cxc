# Changes in xspec-models-cxc

## 0.0.10

Support the `spectrum` argument to all models and, for non-FORTRAN
models, the `initStr` argument.

## 0.0.9

Support C-style models. This bumps the number of supported models to
209 (there are 8 new models in this release).

## 0.0.8

An internal change to better use XSPEC types and which simplifies the
internals (no need to re-create the FORTRAN signatures).

## 0.0.7

Support FORTRAN models (at least for additive and multiplicative
models). This bumps the number of models from 115 to 201.

Note that a FORTRAN compiler is not required (although it will have
been needed to build XSPEC).

## 0.0.6

The initalization of the XSPEC model library is now done
automatically, the first time any routine is called, rather than
requiring an explicit call to a `init` function. The screen output the
initialization creates - that is, displaying the default abundance and
cross-section tables - has now been hidden.

The error-handling has been improved to raise errors other than
RuntimeError when appropriate.

## 0.0.5

Improve the module documentation. It's still not great but it is a
move in the right direction.

## 0.0.4

Start transitioning to `setup.cfg`. This seems to work...

There should be no functional changes in this release, other than that
NumPy shuold now be installed if not already available.

## 0.0.3

The first steps in auto-generating code: all the C++-style additive
and multiplicative models are now supported (there are 115 of
them). We use the [parse-xspec](https://github.com/cxcsds/parse_xspec)
package to extract the information from the `model.dat` file, but this
is handled for you at build time and isn't needed at runtime.

## 0.0.2

There is no functional change but the model interface is generated by
a template rather than being hard coded.

## 0.0.1

A minimum viable product to show an interface to the XSPEC model
library that lets you call some functions and evaluate a model.

Issues include, but are not limited to:

- the model interface is not automatically generated
- many missing functions
- there is no information about each model
- initialization is manual
- how can we use the functionality to support user models
  (from a different Python package)
- the build is fragile
