# Changes in xspec-models-cxc

## 0.0.1

A minimum viable product to show an interface to the XSPEC model
library that lets you call some functions and evaluate a model.

Issues include, but are not limited to:

- the model interface is not automatically generated
- many missing functions
- there is no information about each model
- initialization is manual
- how can we use the functionality to support user models
  (from a different Python package)
- the build is fragile
