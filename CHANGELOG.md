# Changes in xspec-models-cxc

## 0.0.3

The first steps in auto-generating code: all the C++-style additive
and multiplicative models are now supported (there are 115 of
them). We use the [parse-xspec](https://github.com/cxcsds/parse_xspec)
package to extract the information from the `model.dat` file, but this
is handled for you at build time and isn't needed at runtime.

## 0.0.2

There is no functional change but the model interface is generated by
a template rather than being hard coded.

## 0.0.1

A minimum viable product to show an interface to the XSPEC model
library that lets you call some functions and evaluate a model.

Issues include, but are not limited to:

- the model interface is not automatically generated
- many missing functions
- there is no information about each model
- initialization is manual
- how can we use the functionality to support user models
  (from a different Python package)
- the build is fragile
